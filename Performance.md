# Time Distributions & Performance Output
Note that speedup and time varies per run, this is the best times I got. I am using a M1 macbook pro 14 inch 2021

## parallel_avg_pixel
Sequantial Time Output: 3.05s
Parallel Time Output: 1.922s
Speedup: 36.9836%

## parallel_to_grayscale
Sequantial Time Output: 8.05s
Parallel Time Output: 3.72s
Speedup: 53.7888%

## parallel_convolution
Sequantial Time Output: 12.635s
Parallel Time Output: 9.32s
Speedup: 26.2366%
