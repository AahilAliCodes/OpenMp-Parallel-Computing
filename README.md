## OpenMp-Parallel-Computing
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which multiple tasks or processes are executed simultaneously, allowing a program to complete tasks more quickly by dividing them into smaller subtasks that can be performed concurrently.  Benefits of parallel computing include faster execution of tasks, the ability to handle more complex problems, and improved efficiency in utilizing modern hardware.

# Summary of this project: 
The code provided demonstrates how to leverage parallelism using OpenMP to enhance the performance of image processing tasks. Parallel processing is crucial in image processing due to the computational demands of working with large images and complex operations. By efficiently distributing the workload across multiple threads, these code segments optimize the processing of images and contribute to faster and more efficient image manipulation and analysis.
